         Healthy eating is not about strict dietary limitations, staying unrealistically thin, 
or depriving yourself of the foods you love. Rather, it’s about feeling great, having more energy, 
improving your outlook, and stabilizing your mood. If you feel overwhelmed by all the conflicting 
nutrition and diet advice out there, you’re not alone. It seems that for every expert who tells 
you a certain food is good for you, you’ll find another saying exactly the opposite. But by using 
these simple tips, you can cut through the confusion and learn how to create a tasty, varied, and
 healthy diet that is as good for your mind as it is for your body.
